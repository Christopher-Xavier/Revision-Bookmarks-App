A BookMark App

I can see a list of my bookmarks when i first open app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

Can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed view
 Detailed view expands to additionally display description and "Visit Site" link

I can remove my bookmarks list

I receive appropriate feedback when i cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

I can select from a dropdown (< a select element >) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen section

(Extension feature- optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
